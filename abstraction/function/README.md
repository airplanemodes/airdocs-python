# `function`

Function objects are created by function [definitions](/abstraction/function/definition.md).

The only operation on a function object is to call it: `func(arguments)`.

There are really two flavors of function objects: [built-in functions](/built-in-functions/) and user-defined functions. Both support the same operation (to call the function), but the implementation is different, hence the different object types.
