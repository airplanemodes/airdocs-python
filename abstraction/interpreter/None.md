# None

An object frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not passed to a function.

Assignments to `None` are illegal and raise a [`SyntaxError`](/exceptions/SyntaxError.md). `None` is the sole instance of the [`NoneType`](/modules/types/NoneType.md) type.
