# input()
If the **prompt** argument is present, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.

### Syntax
```python
input()
input(prompt)
```

!> When EOF is read, `EOFError` is raised.

### Examples
