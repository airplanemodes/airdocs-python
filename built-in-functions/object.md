# object()

Return a new featureless object.

[`object`](/abstraction/object/) is a base for all classes. It has methods that are common to all instances of Python classes.

This function does not accept any arguments.

?> `object` does not have a [`__dict__`](/abstraction/function/__dict__.md), so you canâ€™t assign arbitrary attributes to an instance of the `object` class.

### Syntax

```python
object()
```
