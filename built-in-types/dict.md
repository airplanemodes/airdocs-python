# dict
Dictionaries represent finite sets of objects indexed by nearly arbitrary values. The only types of values not acceptable as keys are values containing lists or dictionaries or other mutable types that are compared by value rather than by object identity, the reason being that the efficient implementation of dictionaries requires a keyâ€™s hash value to remain constant. Numeric types used for keys obey the normal rules for numeric comparison: if two numbers compare equal (e.g., `1` and `1.0`) then they can be used interchangeably to index the same dictionary entry.

Dictionaries preserve insertion order, meaning that keys will be produced in the same order they were added sequentially over the dictionary. Replacing an existing key does not change the order, however removing a key and re-inserting it will add it to the end instead of keeping its old place.

Dictionaries are mutable.

Dictionaries can be created by several means:

- Use a comma-separated list of `key: value` pairs within braces:
```python
# Strings as keys
{'jack': 4098, 'sjoerd': 4127}
# Integers as keys
{4098: 'jack', 4127: 'sjoerd'}
```
- Use a dict comprehension: `{}`, `{x: x ** 2 for x in range(10)}`.
- Use the type constructor: [`dict()`](/built-in-functions/dict.md).
