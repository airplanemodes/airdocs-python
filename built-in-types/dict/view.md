# view

The objects returned by [`dict.keys()`](/built-in-types/dict/keys.md), [`dict.values()`](/built-in-types/dict/values.md) and [`dict.items()`](/built-in-types/dict/items.md) are `view` objects. They provide a dynamic view on the dictionaryâ€™s entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes.

Dictionary views can be iterated over to yield their respective data, and support membership tests.

### Examples

```python
>>> a = {1: 100, 2: 200}
>>> type(a) # <class 'dict'>
>>> b = a.items()
>>> c = a.keys()
>>> d = a.values()
>>> type(b) # <class 'dict_items'>
>>> type(c) # <class 'dict_keys'>
>>> type(d) # <class 'dict_values'>
>>> a # {1: 100, 2: 200}
>>> b # dict_items([(1, 100), (2, 200)])
>>> c # dict_keys([1, 2])
>>> d # dict_values([100, 200])
```

`view` object can be converted:

```python
>>> a = {'num1': 30, 'num2': 50}
>>> list(a.values()) # [30, 50]
>>> list(a.keys()) # ['num1', 'num2']
```
