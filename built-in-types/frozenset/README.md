# frozenset

The `frozenset` type is immutable and hashable counterpart to [`set`](/built-in-types/set/) objects â€” its contents cannot be altered after it is created. It can therefore be used as a dictionary key or as an element of another set.

They are created by the built-in [`frozenset()`](/built-in-functions/frozenset.md) constructor.
