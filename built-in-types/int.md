# int
Integers represent numbers in an unlimited range, subject to available (virtual) memory only. For the purpose of shift and mask operations, a binary representation is assumed, and negative numbers are represented in a variant of 2â€™s complement which gives the illusion of an infinite string of sign bits extending to the left.
