# list

Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by application).

Lists may be constructed in several ways:
- Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list: `[]`.
- Using square brackets, separating items with commas: `["a"]`, `["a", "b", "c"]`.
- Using a list comprehension: `[x for x in iterable]`.
- Using the type constructor: [`list()`](/built-in-functions/list.md).
