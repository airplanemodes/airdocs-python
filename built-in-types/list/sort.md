# list.sort()

This method sorts the list in place, using only `<` comparisons between items. Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison operations fail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be left in a partially modified state).

`sort()` accepts two arguments that can only be passed by keyword (keyword-only arguments):

**key** specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element (for example, `key=str.lower`). The key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process. The default value of `None` means that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate key value.

The [`functools.cmp_to_key()`](/modules/functools/cmp_to_key.md) utility is available to convert a 2.x style *cmp* function to a **key** function.

**reverse** is a boolean value. If set to `True`, then the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed.

This method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when sorting a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the sorted sequence (use [`sorted()`](/built-in-functions/sorted.md) to explicitly request a new sorted list instance).

The `sort()` method is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal â€” this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by department, then by salary grade).

?> **CPython implementation detail:** While a list is being sorted, the effect of attempting to mutate, or even inspect, the list is undefined. The C implementation of Python makes the list appear empty for the duration, and raises [`ValueError`](/exceptions/ValueError.md) if it can detect that the list has been mutated during a sort.

### Syntax

```python
list.sort(*, key=None, reverse=False)
list.sort()
