# DeprecationWarning

Base class for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are intended for other Python developers.

Ignored by the default warning filters, except in the `__main__` module ([**PEP 565**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0565/)). Enabling the Python Development Mode shows this warning.

The deprecation policy is described in [**PEP 387**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0387/).
