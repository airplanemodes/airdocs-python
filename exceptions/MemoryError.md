# MemoryError

Raised when an operation runs out of memory but the situation may still be rescued (by deleting some objects). The associated value is a string indicating what kind of (internal) operation ran out of memory. Note that because of the underlying memory management architecture (Câ€™s `malloc()` function), the interpreter may not always be able to completely recover from this situation. It nevertheless raises an exception so that a stack traceback can be printed, in case a run-away program was the cause.
