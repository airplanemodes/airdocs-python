# OverflowError
Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented. This cannot occur for integers (which would rather raise `MemoryError` than give up). However, for historical reasons, OverflowError is sometimes raised for integers that are outside a required range. Because of the lack of standardization of floating point exception handling in C, most floating point operations are not checked.
