# SystemError

Raised when the interpreter finds an internal error, but the situation does not look so serious to cause it to abandon all hope. The associated value is a string indicating what went wrong (in low-level terms).

You should report this to the author or maintainer of your Python interpreter. Be sure to report the version of the Python interpreter (`sys.version`, it is also printed at the start of an interactive Python session), the exact error message (the exceptionâ€™s associated value) and if possible the source of the program that triggered the error.
