# array.buffer_info()

Return a tuple `(address, length)` giving the current memory address and the length in elements of the buffer used to hold arrayâ€™s contents.

The size of the memory buffer in bytes can be computed as `array.buffer_info()[1] * array.itemsize`. This is occasionally useful when working with low-level (and inherently unsafe) I/O interfaces that require memory addresses, such as certain `ioctl()` operations. The returned numbers are valid as long as the array exists and no length-changing operations are applied to it.

?> When using array objects from code written in C or C++ (the only way to effectively make use of this information), it makes more sense to use the buffer interface supported by array objects. This method is maintained for backward compatibility and should be avoided in new code.

### Syntax

```python
array.array.buffer_info()
