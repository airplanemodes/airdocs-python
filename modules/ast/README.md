# ast

**Abstract Syntax Trees.**

> Source code: [`Lib/ast.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.11/Lib/ast.py)

The `ast` module helps Python applications to process trees of the Python abstract syntax grammar. The abstract syntax itself might change with each Python release. This module helps to find out programmatically what the current grammar looks like.
