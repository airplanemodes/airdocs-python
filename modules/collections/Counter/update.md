# collections.Counter.update()

Elements are counted from an **iterable** or added-in from another mapping (or counter).

Like [`dict.update()`](/built-in-types/dict/update.md) but adds counts instead of replacing them. Also, the **iterable** is expected to be a sequence of elements, not a sequence of `(key, value)` pairs.

### Syntax

```python
collections.Counter.update(iterable)
```
