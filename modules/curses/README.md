# curses

**Terminal handling for character-cell displays.**

> Source code: [`Lib/curses`](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/curses)

The `curses` module provides an interface to the curses library, the de-facto standard for portable advanced terminal handling.

While curses is most widely used in the Unix environment, versions are available for Windows, DOS, and possibly other systems as well. This extension module is designed to match the API of ncurses, an open-source curses library hosted on Linux and the BSD variants of Unix.
