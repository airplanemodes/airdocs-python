# curses.baudrate()

`>>> curses.baudrate.__doc__`: Return the output speed of the terminal in bits per second.

On software terminal emulators it will have a fixed high value. Included for historical reasons. In former times, it was used to write output loops for time delays and occasionally to change interfaces depending on the line speed.

### Syntax
