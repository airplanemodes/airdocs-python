# curses.getmouse()

After [`getch()`](/modules/curses/window/getch.md) returns KEY_MOUSE to signal a mouse event, this method should be called to retrieve the queued mouse event, represented as a 5-tuple `(id, x, y, z, bstate)`. 

**id** is an ID value used to distinguish multiple devices, and **x**, **y**, **z** are the eventâ€™s coordinates (**z** is currently unused). 

**bstate** is an integer value whose bits will be set to indicate the type of event, and will be the bitwise OR of one or more of the following constants, where **n** is the button number from 1 to 5: BUTTONn_PRESSED, BUTTONn_RELEASED, BUTTONn_CLICKED, BUTTONn_DOUBLE_CLICKED, BUTTONn_TRIPLE_CLICKED, BUTTON_SHIFT, BUTTON_CTRL, BUTTON_ALT.
