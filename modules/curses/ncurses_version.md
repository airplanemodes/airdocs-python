# curses.ncurses_version

> **Availability:** if the ncurses library is used.

A named tuple containing the three components of the ncurses library version: **major**, **minor**, and **patch**. All values are integers. 

The components can also be accessed by name, so `curses.ncurses_version[0]` is equivalent to `curses.ncurses_version.major` and so on.


### Syntax
