# window.resize()

Reallocate storage for a curses window to adjust its dimensions to the specified values. If either dimension is larger than the current values, the windowâ€™s data is filled with blanks that have the current background rendition (as set by [`bkgdset()`](/modules/curses/window/bkgdset.md)) merged into them.

### Syntax

```python
window.resize(nlines, ncols)
```
