# getopt

**C-style parser for command line options.**

This module helps scripts to parse the command line arguments in [`sys.argv`](/modules/sys/argv.md). It supports the same conventions as the Unix `getopt()` function (including the special meanings of arguments of the form ‘`-`’ and ‘`--`‘). Long options similar to those supported by GNU software may be used as well via an optional third argument.
