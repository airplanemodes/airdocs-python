**Multilingual internationalization services.**

> Source code: [`Lib/gettext.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/gettext.py)

The `gettext` module provides internationalization (I18N) and localization (L10N) services for your Python modules and applications. It supports both the GNU gettext message catalog API and a higher level, class-based API that may be more appropriate for Python files. The interface described below allows you to write your module and application messages in one natural language, and provide a catalog of translated messages for running under different natural languages.
