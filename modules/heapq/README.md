# heapq

**Heap queue algorithm.**

> Source code: [`Lib/heapq.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/heapq.py)

This module provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.

Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children. We refer to this condition as the heap invariant.

This implementation uses arrays for which `heap[k] <= heap[2*k+1]` and `heap[k] <= heap[2*k+2]` for all *k*, counting elements from zero. For the sake of comparison, non-existing elements are considered to be infinite. The interesting property of a heap is that its smallest element is always the root, `heap[0]`.

The API below differs from textbook heap algorithms in two aspects: (a) We use zero-based indexing. This makes the relationship between the index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses zero-based indexing. (b) Our pop method returns the smallest item, not the largest (called a “min heap” in textbooks; a “max heap” is more common in texts because of its suitability for in-place sorting).

These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list without surprises: `heap[0]` is the smallest item, and `heap.sort()` maintains the heap invariant!

To create a heap, use a list initialized to `[]`, or you can transform a populated list into a heap via function [`heapify()`](/modules/heapq/heapify.md).
