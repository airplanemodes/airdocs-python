# heapq.heappushpop()

Push **item** on the heap, then pop and return the smallest item from the **heap**.

The combined action runs more efficiently than [`heappush()`](/modules/heapq/heappush.md) followed by a separate call to [`heappop()`](/modules/heapq/heappop.md).

### Syntax

```python
heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
```
