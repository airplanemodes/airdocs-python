# html.entities.html5

A dictionary that maps HTML5 named character references to the equivalent Unicode character(s), e.g. `html5['gt;'] == '>'`.

Note that the trailing semicolon is included in the name (e.g. `'gt;'`), however some of the names are accepted by the standard even without the semicolon: in this case the name is present with and without the `';'`.
