# http.client

**HTTP protocol client.**

> Source code: [`Lib/http/client.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/http/client.py)

This module defines classes that implement the client side of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. It is normally not used directly â€” the module `urllib.request` uses it to handle URLs that use HTTP and HTTPS.
