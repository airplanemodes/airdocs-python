# http.server

**HTTP servers.**

> Source code: [`Lib/http/server.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.11/Lib/http/server.py)

This module defines classes for implementing HTTP servers.

## http.server.HTTPServer()
This class builds on the [`TCPServer`](/modules/socketserver?id=socketservertcpserver) class by storing the server address as instance variables named `server_name` and `server_port`. The server is accessible by the handler, typically through the handlerâ€™s server instance variable.

### Syntax
```python
http.server.HTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass)
```
