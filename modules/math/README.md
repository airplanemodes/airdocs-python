**Mathematical functions.**

This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

These functions cannot be used with complex numbers. Use the functions of the same name from the [`cmath`](/modules/cmath/) module if you require support for complex numbers. The distinction between functions which support complex numbers and those which donâ€™t is made since most users do not want to learn quite as much mathematics as required to understand complex numbers. Receiving an exception instead of a complex result allows earlier detection of the unexpected complex number used as a parameter, so that the programmer can determine how and why it was generated in the first place.
