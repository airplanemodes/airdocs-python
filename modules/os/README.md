# os

**Miscellaneous operating system interfaces.**

> Source code: [`Lib/os.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.11/Lib/os.py)

This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

If you just want to read or write a file see [`open()`](/built-in-functions/open.md), if you want to manipulate paths, see the [`os.path`](/modules/os/path/) module, and if you want to read all the lines in all the files on the command line see the [`fileinput`](/modules/fileinput.md) module. For creating temporary files and directories see the [`tempfile`](/modules/tempfile.md) module, and for high-level file and directory handling see the [`shutil`](/modules/shutil.md) module.
