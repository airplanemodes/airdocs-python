# random.expovariate()

Exponential distribution.

**lambd** is 1.0 divided by the desired mean. It should be nonzero. 

Returned values range from 0 to positive infinity if **lambd** is positive, and from negative infinity to 0 if **lambd** is negative.

?> The parameter would be called “lambda”, but that is a reserved word in Python.

### Syntax

```python
randon.expovariate(lambd)
```
