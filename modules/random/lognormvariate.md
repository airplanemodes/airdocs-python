# random.lognormvariate()

Log normal distribution.

If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, youâ€™ll get a normal distribution with mean **mu** and standard deviation **sigma**. **mu** can have any value, and **sigma** must be greater than zero.

### Syntax

```python
random.lognormvariate(mu, sigma)
```
