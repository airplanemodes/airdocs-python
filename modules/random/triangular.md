# random.triangular()

Return a random floating point number *N* such that `low <= N <= high` and with the specified **mode** between those bounds.

The **low** and **high** bounds default to zero and one.

The **mode** argument defaults to the midpoint between the bounds, giving a symmetric distribution.

### Syntax

```python
random.triangular(low, high, mode)
```
