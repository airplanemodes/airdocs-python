# random.vonmisesvariate()

**mu** is the mean angle, expressed in radians between `0` and `2*pi`, and **kappa** is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or equal to zero. If **kappa** is equal to zero, this distribution reduces to a uniform random angle over the range `0` to `2*pi`.

### Syntax

```python
random.vonmisesvariate(mu, kappa)
```
