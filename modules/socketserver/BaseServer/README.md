# socketserver.BaseServer()

This is the superclass of all Server objects in the module. It defines the interface, given below, but does not implement most of the methods, which is done in subclasses. The two parameters are stored in the respective [`server_address`](/modules/socketserver/BaseServer/server_address.md) and [`RequestHandlerClass`](/modules/socketserver/BaseServer/RequestHandlerClass.md) attributes.
