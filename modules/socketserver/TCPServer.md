# socketserver.TCPServer()

This uses the internet TCP protocol, which provides for continuous streams of data between the client and server. If **bind_and_activate** is true, the constructor automatically attempts to invoke `server_bind()` and `server_activate()`. The other parameters are passed to the `BaseServer` base class.

### Syntax

```python
socketserver.TCPServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass, bind_and_activate=True)
```

### Examples

This is the server side:

```python
import socketserver

class MyTCPHandler(socketserver.BaseRequestHandler):
    """
    The request handler class for our server.

    It is instantiated once per connection to the server, and must
    override the handle() method to implement communication to the
    client.
    """

    def handle(self):
        # self.request is the TCP socket connected to the client
        self.data = self.request.recv(1024).strip()
        print("Received from {}:".format(self.client_address[0]))
        print(self.data)
        # just send back the same data, but upper-cased
        self.request.sendall(self.data.upper())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    HOST, PORT = "localhost", 9999

    # Create the server, binding to localhost on port 9999
    with socketserver.TCPServer((HOST, PORT), MyTCPHandler) as server:
        # Activate the server; this will keep running until you
        # interrupt the program with Ctrl-C
        server.serve_forever()
```

An alternative request handler class that makes use of streams (file-like objects that simplify communication by providing the standard file interface):

```python
class MyTCPHandler(socketserver.StreamRequestHandler):

    def handle(self):
        # self.rfile is a file-like object created by the handler;
        # we can now use e.g. readline() instead of raw recv() calls
        self.data = self.rfile.readline().strip()
        print("{} wrote:".format(self.client_address[0]))
        print(self.data)
        # Likewise, self.wfile is a file-like object used to write back
        # to the client
        self.wfile.write(self.data.upper())
```

The difference is that the `readline()` call in the second handler will call `recv()` multiple times until it encounters a newline character, while the single `recv()` call in the first handler will just return what has been received so far from the clientâ€™s `sendall()` call (typically all of it, but this is not guaranteed by the TCP protocol).

This is the client side:

```python
import socket
import sys

HOST, PORT = "localhost", 9999
data = " ".join(sys.argv[1:])

# Create a socket (SOCK_STREAM means a TCP socket)
with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
    # Connect to server and send data
    sock.connect((HOST, PORT))
    sock.sendall(bytes(data + "\n", "utf-8"))

    # Receive data from the server and shut down
    received = str(sock.recv(1024), "utf-8")

print("Sent:     {}".format(data))
print("Received: {}".format(received))
```

The output of the example should look something like this:

Server:

```shell
python TCPServer.py
# 127.0.0.1 wrote:
# b'hello world with TCP'
# 127.0.0.1 wrote:
# b'python is nice'
```

Client:

```shell
python TCPClient.py hello world with TCP
# Sent:     hello world with TCP
# Received: HELLO WORLD WITH TCP
python TCPClient.py python is nice
# Sent:     python is nice
# Received: PYTHON IS NICE
```
