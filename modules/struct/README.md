**Interpret bytes as packed binary data.**

This module converts between Python values and C structs represented as Python [`bytes`](/built-in-types/bytes/) objects. Compact format strings describe the intended conversions to/from Python values. The moduleâ€™s functions and objects can be used for two largely distinct applications, data exchange with external sources (files or network connections), or data transfer between the Python application and the C layer.
