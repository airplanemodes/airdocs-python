# symtable

**Access to the compilerâ€™s symbol tables.**

> Source code: [`Lib/symtable.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.11/Lib/symtable.py)

Symbol tables are generated by the compiler from AST just before bytecode is generated. The symbol table is responsible for calculating the scope of every identifier in the code. `symtable` provides an interface to examine these tables.
