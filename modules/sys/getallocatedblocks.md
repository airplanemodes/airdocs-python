# sys.getallocatedblocks()

Return the number of memory blocks currently allocated by the interpreter, regardless of their size. This function is mainly useful for tracking and debugging memory leaks. Because of the interpreterâ€™s internal caches, the result can vary from call to call. You may have to call [`_clear_type_cache()`](/modules/sys/_clear_type_cache.md) and [`gc.collect()`](/modules/gc/collect.md) to get more predictable results.

If a Python build or implementation cannot reasonably compute this information, `getallocatedblocks()` is allowed to return 0 instead.

### Syntax

```python
sys.getallocatedblocks()
