# time

**Time access and conversions.**

This module provides various time-related functions. For related functionality, see also the [`datetime`](/modules/datetime/) and [`calendar`](/modules/calendar/) modules.

Although this module is always available, not all functions are available on all platforms. Most of the functions defined in this module call platform C library functions with the same name. It may sometimes be helpful to consult the platform documentation, because the semantics of these functions varies among platforms.
