# types

**Dynamic type creation and names for built-in types.**

> Source code: [`Lib/types.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/types.py)

This module defines utility functions to assist in dynamic creation of new types.

It also defines names for some object types that are used by the standard Python interpreter, but not exposed as builtins like [`int`](/built-in-types/int/) or [`str`](/built-in-types/str/) are.

Finally, it provides some additional type-related utility classes and functions that are not fundamental enough to be builtins.
