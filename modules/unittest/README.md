**Unit testing framework.**

> Source code: [`Lib/unittest/__init__.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/unittest/__init__.py)

The `unittest` unit testing framework was originally inspired by JUnit and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other languages. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.
