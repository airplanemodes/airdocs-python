# warnings

**Warning control.**

> Source code: [`Lib/warnings.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/warnings.py)

Warning messages are typically issued in situations where it is useful to alert the user of some condition in a program, where that condition (normally) doesnâ€™t warrant raising an exception and terminating the program. For example, one might want to issue a warning when a program uses an obsolete module.
