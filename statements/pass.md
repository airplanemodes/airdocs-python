# pass
`pass` is a null operation â€” when it is executed, nothing happens. It is useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically, but no code needs to be executed.

### Syntax
```python
pass
```

### Examples
A function that does nothing:
```python
def f(): pass
```

A class with no methods:
```python
class C: pass
```
